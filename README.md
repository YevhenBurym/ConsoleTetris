# Console Tetris
this project is a simple implementation of classic tetris in console without using third-party libraries (except for the deprecated conio.h).
## What has been implemented:
- counting the destroyed lines and displaying it on the screen.
- the appearance of a figure in a random position.
- display of the next figure that should appear.
- raising the level of difficulty by increasing the speed of falling figures every 10 lines.
- 7 different figures (as in classic Tetris) and the possibility of their rotation.
## Used
- Cpp
- conio.h
## How to run this project
 - clone branch `main` with `https://github.com/YevhenBurym/ConsoleTetris.git` or fork it and then clone it from your forked repo.
 - The project can be built using a makefile in the project's root directory.
 - You can also run the compiled game through the executable file `ConsoleTetris.exe` in the root directory of the project.
